# Jadeify Has Moved

Jadeify was not being kept up to date with the latest advances in browserify magic, so we moved it to [domenic/jadeify](https://github.com/domenic/jadeify). It is now a Browserify 2.x/3.x transform, instead of a Connect middleware.

You can still get old releases from npm; everything in the 0.x range is derived from this repository.

If you want to see the README before this move [GitHub has you covered](https://github.com/substack/node-jadeify/blob/bb338d4df7ae466a57e666a985466af3f30918f2/README.markdown).
